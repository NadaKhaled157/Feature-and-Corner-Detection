# Feature and Corner Detection

<p align="justify">A focused computer vision project to extract, describe, and match image features using classical techniques such as Harris Corner Detection, SIFT descriptors, SSD matching, and normalized cross-correlation. Designed as part of an academic assignment, this toolkit supports grayscale and color images.</p>

## Objective

Perform keypoint-based image feature analysis, including feature detection, descriptor generation, and image feature matching.

## Tasks Implemented

### 1. **Feature Extraction**
- Detect unique features using:
  - **Harris Corner Detector**
  - **Minimum eigenvalue method (λ⁻)**
- Measure and report **computation times** for each method.

### 2. **Feature Description**
- Compute **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)** descriptors.
- Record **descriptor generation time** for performance evaluation.

### 3. **Feature Matching**
- Use both:
  - **Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)**
  - **Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC)**
- Match features across image sets and report:
  - Matched keypoints
  - **Computation times** for both matching methods
